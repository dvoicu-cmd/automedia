Writing publisher formulas:

1) Init PublisherDirManager
2) Get the tmp dir file address from DirManager
3) Init DbNasConnection and identify the account type you are pulling content from (ex: yt, instagram)
4) Based on the account type, load in the content file/files, likely at random, from the desired account
5) Call the specific strategy for that account type and upload details. ex: yt_video: take description, title, thumbnail, and video.
6) Set the pulled record to archived
