Writing publisher formulas:

1) Lock other services from running
2) Identify the account type you are pulling content from
3) Based on the account type, load in the content file/files, likely at random, from the desired account
3) Call the specific strategy for that account type and upload details. ex: yt_video: take description, title, thumbnail, and video.
4) Set the pulled record to archived
5) Unlock to allow other services to run
