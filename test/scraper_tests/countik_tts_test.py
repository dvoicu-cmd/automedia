tts = TextUtils.split_sentences("The crimson sky whispered secrets to the wandering clouds. Jazz notes danced through the moonlit air, creating a symphony of serenity. A lone cat prowled the empty streets, a shadow in the night. Laughter echoed from a distant cafe, a celebration of moments. Fragrant flowers bloomed in the garden, painting nature's canvas. An old book on the shelf held stories of forgotten realms and adventures. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped the cozy corner of the room. Footsteps echoed in the empty hallway, a rhythmic dance of solitude. A flickering streetlamp cast eerie shadows on the cobblestone path. The ticking of a vintage clock marked the passage of silent hours. Whispers of the past lingered in the ancient library, waiting to be discovered. A gentle breeze carried the sweet scent of pine from the nearby forest. The flickering candlelight revealed pages of an old love letter, a testament to timeless emotions. Waves crashed against the rugged cliffs, a relentless dance of sea and land. A neon sign buzzed with life, inviting wanderers to a hidden speakeasy. Rustling leaves in the autumn breeze painted a tapestry of gold and red. The distant howl of a wolf echoed through the tranquil night, a primal song. The city skyline sparkled with a thousand lights, a modern constellation. Reflections danced on the surface of a tranquil lake, mirroring the world's beauty. Shadows played on the walls of an ancient castle, guarding its untold stories. In the quiet meadow, fireflies illuminated the darkness, a celestial dance. The distant chime of church bells echoed through the sleepy village, a timeless melody.", 300)
